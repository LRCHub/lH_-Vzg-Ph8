Don't stop trying to love me
so I keep dying
When,
when I see you
I don't understand
the chemistry behind it
The puzzle piece that I've
been trying to find, and
You're like medicine,
for the weak you give
me confidence
When I speak,
is this what love is?
Like, am I losing my mind?
Oh, hey,
now I've got a fuzzy feeling
in my chest
Butterflies inside my
stomach and I bet
You don't have a clue
what you've been doing to me,
doing to me
And, darling,
I've been lying 'bout
a certain kind of feeling
A deer in the lights,
like a catch that you've
been reeling out
Hunted down, scouted out,
a predator to pray
(Predator to pray)
An accident, intentional
Who's to say but I've been yours
From the one girl it's that easy
To fall for you dear
It's like life needs
it's breathing, I
I wanna make you my everything,
oh
You wouldn't ever have to leave
Oh, baby, can't you see it?
Oh, but I
(Oh, hey)
Now I've got a fuzzy feeling
in my chest
(I've got)
Butterflies inside my
stomach and I bet
(I've been)
You don't have a clue
what you've been doing to me,
doing to me
Oh, hey,
now I've got a fuzzy feeling
in my chest
Butterflies inside my
stomach and I bet
(I've been, yeah)
You don't have a clue
what you've been doing to me,
doing to me
Oh, no,
you know I've got this
fuzzy feeling playing
And you don't even know
what you're doing to me,
doing to me
